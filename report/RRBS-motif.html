    <h2>RRBS</h2>
    <p>Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) uses a methylation-insensitive restriction enzyme, usually
        <code>MspI</code> with the cutting target <code>5'CCGG3'</code> sequences, to enrich CpG-rich sequences.

        <h3>RRBS CpGs summary</h3>
        <p>The proportion of CCGG-context CpGs over all CpGs in the genome is {{alldata.ccgg_prop}}% (lefttop figure).
            The
            mean single-stranded methylation read depth of CCGG-context CpGs is {{alldata.ccgg_mean_dp}} (leftbottom
            figure). The coverage
            rate and mean methyaltion level of CCGG- and non-CCGG-context CpGs with varing depth thresholds are shown in
            righttop and rightbottom figures, respectively.</p>
