            The strand difference is essential for bisulfite sequencing. As
            the sequenced reads increase, the genome coverage increases. bsDoctor
            simulates the process by sampling the mapped reads/bases
            hypergeometrically.

            In the following figure, x-axis represents single-stranded sequencing
            depth, y-axis represents single-stranded whole-genome coverage. The dashed line is the estimated asymptotic
            whole-genome coverage if this library is sequenced continuously.
